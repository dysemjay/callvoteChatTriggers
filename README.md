# callvoteChatTriggers

A very simple plugin to create basic chat triggers for "callvote" commands. It will do so by checking the contents of chat messages submitted using the "say" and "say_team" commands. If the chat message begins with "/callvote" for the silent chat trigger, or "!callvote" for the public chat trigger, then the contents of the chat message after the trigger will be executed as a fake client command. More information about chat triggers may be found here: https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Commands...#Chat_Triggers

Note that the functionality of this plugin is limited in that it will not echo console messages generated by the callvote command to the player's chat.

Example:
```
say "/callvote map_restart"
```

Should be equivalent to entering the following into console:
```
callvote map_restart
```

There should be no chat message generated by this example.
